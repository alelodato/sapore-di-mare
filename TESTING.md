# Sapore di Mare Testing

As each section or Function/Model was built during this project, I was testing for functionality and styling issues that may have arisen (see table below), which were corrected or fixed before continuing. I also had friends test the site by signing up, adding and deleting comments using various devices on varying platforms (IOS, Android, Mobile, Tablet etc) and reporting back any issues they encountered with functionality or styling.

### Automated Testing

For this project, automated tests were implemented using **Djangoâ€™s built-in TestCase** framework.  
The tests focus on the `Reservation` model and the `get_available_tables` utility function to ensure that the booking system behaves correctly in different scenarios.  

- **ReservationModelTest**  
  - Verifies that a reservation can be successfully created with a table, date, time, and number of guests.  
  - Ensures that the data saved in the database matches the expected values (e.g., reservation name and assigned table).  

- **UtilsTest**  
  - **test_available_table_when_free**: Confirms that tables with no reservations are returned as available when queried for a specific date and time.  
  - **test_unavailable_when_reserved**: Ensures that once a table is reserved at a given time, it no longer appears in the list of available tables, while other free tables remain available.  

These tests validate the **core booking logic** of the system: preventing overlapping reservations and correctly filtering tables based on their availability. They can be executed with the command:

```bash
python manage.py test booking
